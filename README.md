# FraudShield 🛡️

## Introduction 🎯

FraudShield is a Streamlit-powered demonstration app showcasing the semi-supervised learning system for detecting banking fraud. It utilizes the BAF Dataset Suite, engineered from real-world data and designed to stress-test machine learning methods under dynamic conditions. FraudShield integrates both supervised learning models and unsupervised anomaly detection to highlight the potential of hybrid approaches in fraud prevention.

### Features 🌟

* Supervised Fraud Detection: Trained on historical data to recognize patterns.
* Anomaly Detection: Employs unsupervised learning to spot new, unusual fraud signals.
* Semi-Supervised Learning: Combines both methods for improved accuracy.
* Interactive Web App: Built with Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.
* Learning Loop: Incorporates human feedback to fine-tune the detection rules.

### Dataset 📊

The BAF Dataset Suite from Kaggle, developed by Feedzai and the University of Porto, serves as the foundation for the fraud detection models in FraudShield. This dataset is a synthetic, feature-engineered collection, ideal for testing ML fairness and performance in dynamic scenarios.
